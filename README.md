# Dating app 

## Project description

The goal of this project is to learn about web development. We are working as backend aswell as frontend developer and learning about github and their flow. 

Check out the WIKI for my weekly process of project tech!

## Job Story
**When I registrated my profile, I want to manage my profile details, so I can express myself on the datingapp.**
This job story is all about managing your profile. Profile info needs to be `created` , `added`, `updated` and `deleted`

## Concept
It's a dating app that matches users based on their matching party agenda. When people have a common interest, let alone a similar party scheduled, it's way more likely that they meet up.
